74 what's bootstrap

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/

*CSS 
botton...

*Components

75 add bootstrap into a project

1. downloaded locally
differences between normal file and the mininal file: mininal file could be loaded quicker 
just link the bootstrap.css

2. use the cdn links an external file

e.g. buttons in 75.html
1. use some classes
2. use disabled active
3. use extra style sheet inside the same html to overwrite the original bootstrap attributes




76 forms and inputs
jumbotron, forms and inputs

1 jumbotron
see doc

container
could make things center (some box-model things)

2 forms

1) use the most basic forms template

form-group class:
spacing
by default. Wrap labels a nd controls in .form-group for optimum spacing.

form-control class:
did the style for the object, like padding...
if remove, the input will become default web browser input

2) use the form-inline class



77 nav bars

1. need add js and jquery cdn for the dynamic things(like drop down, like hamburger)
2. 
after the header class
add div of class "collapse navbar-collapse"... line to make the navbar could hidden the options depends on the size
3.
in the header class add: 
		<button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false">
        	<span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        	<span class="icon-bar"></span>
        	<span class="icon-bar"></span>
        	<span class="icon-bar"></span>
      		</button>
this code's data-target attribute in button, corresponds to the id of the collapse navbar-collapse class div in step 2


78 79 grid system

each container scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport seze increases

grid system must be used in the container div tags

see the 79.html for understand


80 grid system prt2
1.understand purpose of grid system   (part1)
2.understand the 4 different sizes   ***
3.write nested grids                 ***

4 sizes: use for the responseve features
very-small small midium large
col-xs  col-sm  col-md col-lg
 
corresponds to the different break point when you smaller the browser

just use the smaller option if it same with the bigger options
e.g.
'col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6'
works same with
'col-md-3 col-sm-6'

write nested grids
add rows inside column, fill that row with other columns




81 82 Bootstrap galarry part1
file named 81.html

div thumbnail class could add a border for image, and the border will use the gid system setting length or width 

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-camera" aria-hidden="true"></span> for icon images

make the navbar stay when change size

could add padding between header navbar and body

***
add masonry to make the various size of images work in grid system
kind of success, work in the lg, md, sm, but not for xm
see the 81.html and https://masonry.desandro.com/

83 gallary part2

???specificity
so couldn't change the navbar text color




85 landing page
normally, a new tag created by user has the least specificity, so all other bootstrap class object will not be affect by setting color in the body or content

give html height 100% to make the picture all screen in the browser 

add css shadow
