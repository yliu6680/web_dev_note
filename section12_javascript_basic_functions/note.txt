functions, most important in js

1. functions declarationsa and expression
	2 ways

2. explain differences between console.log and return

3. create functions with multiple arguments

143 functions basic
# why need functions:
wraps up and reuse of the code

# functions with no arguments
execute a function: sayHi();
refferring a function: sayHi;

144 functions with arguments
in js, lack of arguments will not stop the code, but just set an udefined in the function

145 146 functions keywords

the undefine keyword in the js console, is just because the js will run the number or other things as variable, but in fact, they are undefine.

Function Declaration vs function expression
*** Function Expression
*** another way to define js function
var capitalize = function(str) {
  return something
}

147 148 149 functions exercise

regular expression

str = hello,hi,ok
*** var str = str.replace(/,/g, "-")
hello-hi-ok

/<something>/-->the regular expression is between the double "/"
g--> global search the parttern

150 intro to JS scope

scope is the context that code is executed in

*** function defination's scope:  
it has its own scope
higher priority compare with the scope outside the function if the variable name are same, 
and also change the var outside the function

if you use 'variable = something;' the outside same named var will be changed

but if you use 'var variable = something;' inside the function, the outside same named var will not be affected.

*** in other words
if you define a new variable in function defination, it will not affect the same named variable outside the defination;
but if you use the outside same named variable without defined a new one, it will affected the variable outside.

152 Higher Order Functions
pass functions to other functions

# pass functions will not need to write the () after the function names

# use function(){} as an anonymous function as the input function

e.x. 
setInterval(function() {
	console.log("aa");
	console.log("bb");
}, 2000);
